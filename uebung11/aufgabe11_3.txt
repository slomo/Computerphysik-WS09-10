f(x) = -7.349951e-01*x + 1.129781e+00
Coefficient of determination 1.000000


It seems to be a perfect fit, but a look on the plotted values reveals,
that the functions doesent behave linear. It has a linear part right in
the middle of the given interval, where the fit is near perferct. 


The vaules of vary on both sides, so that R2 becomes 1.
